Classes and IDs in HTML

Classes and IDs are attributes that can be added to HTML elements to identify them and apply CSS styles or JavaScript functionality.

Classes can be applied to multiple elements on a page. 
For example, you could have a class called .button that you apply to all of the buttons on your page. 
This would allow you to style all of your buttons in the same way with a single CSS rule.

IDs must be unique on a page. This means that only one element can have a particular ID.
IDs are often used to identify specific elements on a page, such as a header, footer, or main content area.
They can also be used to create anchors that allow users to jump to specific sections of a page.

<p class="button">This is a button.</p>

Styling and Scripting
Once you have added classes and IDs to your HTML elements, you can use them to apply CSS styles and JavaScript functionality.

.button {
  background-color: red;
}

2.ID's
#header {
  color: blue;
}

Best Practices
