To create subpages in HTML, you need to create new HTML files and then link to them from your main HTML file.

To create a new subpage:

Create a new HTML file in the same folder as your main HTML file.
Give the new file a unique name.
Open the new file in your HTML editor and add the necessary HTML code.
Save the file.
To link to a subpage from your main HTML file:

Open your main HTML file in your HTML editor.
Add an anchor tag (<a>) to the page where you want to link to the subpage.
Set the href attribute of the anchor tag to the filename of the subpage.
Add the text for the link inside the anchor tag.
Save the file.
